        The Websites and Applications may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by
        Domino’s. Domino’s has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
        practices of any third party websites. In addition, Domino's will not and cannot censor or edit the content of
        any third-party site. By using the Websites or Applications, you expressly relieve Domino's from any and all
        liability arising from your use of any third-party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you
        leave the Websites or Applications and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other
        website that you visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h6><strong>Website/Application Access</strong></h6>
        Domino's hereby grants you permission to use the Websites as set forth in this Terms of Use, provided that: (i)
        your use of the Websites and Applications as permitted are solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii)
        you will not copy or distribute any part of the Websites or Applications in any medium without Domino's prior
        written authorization; (iii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Websites or Applications other than
        as may be reasonably necessary to use the Websites or Applications for their intended purpose; and (iv) you
        will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>In order to access some features of the Websites or Applications, you will have to create an account. You may
        never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and
        complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must
        keep your account password secure. You must notify Domino's immediately of any breach of security or
        unauthorized use of your account. Although Domino's will not be liable for your losses caused by any
        unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Domino's or others due to such
        unauthorized use.</p>
      <p>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders,"
        "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Websites or Applications in a manner that sends more request
        messages to the Domino's servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same
        period by using a convention on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Domino's grants the operators
        of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of
        creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.
        Domino's reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to
        collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Websites or

        publish your name and User Submission on the Websites, Applications or in other press releases or media items.
        You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing
        them. In connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the
        necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Domino's to use all patent,
        trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable
        inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Websites, Applications and these
        Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable
        individual person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable
        individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the
        Websites, Applications and these Terms of Use. Domino’s may use such submissions in any manner in the sole
        discretion of Domino’s. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your other User Submissions.

        part or all of the Websites or Applications (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
        media channels. You also hereby grant each recipient of any User Submission a non-exclusive license to access
        your User Submissions through the Website or Applications, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare
        derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the
        Websites, Applications and under these Terms of Use.
        In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is
        copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including
        privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful
        owner to post the material and to grant Domino's all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish
        falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Domino's or any third party; (iii) submit material that is
        unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically
        offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability,
        violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business: (v)
        impersonate another person. Domino's does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or
        advice expressed therein, and Domino's expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User
        Submissions. Domino's does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property
        rights on its Websites or Applications, and Domino's will block and remove all Content and User Submissions if
        properly notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights.
        Domino's reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice. Domino's will also
        terminate a User's access to its Websites or Applications, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer. A
        repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity twice and/or has had a User Submission
        removed from the Websites or Applications. Domino's also reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User
        Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use for violations other than copyright infringement
        and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory
        material, or excessive length. Domino's may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for
        uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice and at its sole
        discretion. In addition, you agree that you will not email any of your User Submissions or links to your User
        Submissions to individuals with whom you are not acquainted.
        In particular, if you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other
        content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification to any of our stores.
        You understand that when using the Websites and Applications, you may be exposed to User Submissions from a
        variety of sources, and that Domino's is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual
        property rights of or relating to such User Submissions. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be
        exposed to User Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive,
        and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Domino's with
        respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold Domino's, its Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors,

          invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity
          of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of
